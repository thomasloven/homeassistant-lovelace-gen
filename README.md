# lovelace-gen.py A lovelace configuration generator for [homeassistant](https://www.home-assistant.io)

This script will generate a `ui-lovelace.yaml` file based off a file `lovelace/main.yaml`. Other files in the `lovelace` directory can be included into the configuration using the `!include filename` statement. This allows for separation of the configuration into several files, and reuse of cards.

## Usage

Create a directory `<homeassistant config dir>/lovelace` and the file `<homeassistant config dir>/lovelace/main.yaml`.

Inside your homeassistant config directory, run the command:

    ./lovelace-gen.py

This will create the file `ui_lovelace.yaml`.

**Note:** `lovelace-gen` requires some non-standard python packages to be installed, namely PyYAML, requests and Jinja2. Those are all required by home-assistant, so by running the script in the same environment as hass, you'll get them for free. Also, python3 is required.

#### Usage in Hass.io

Create a directory `config/lovelace` and the file `config/lovelace/main.yaml`.

In your configuration.yaml file, make a shell command:

```yaml
shell_command:
  lovelace_gen: 'python /config/lovelace-gen.py'
  ```

Restart Home Assistant. Then run the service `shell_command.lovelace_gen`, preferably from `<hass_ip_address:port>/dev-service`.

This will create the file `ui_lovelace.yaml`.

## Special commands

The following commands can be used in `lovelace/main.yaml` or any file included using the `!include` command.

- `!include <filename>` is replaced with the contents of `lovelace/<filename>`.
- `!resource [<path>/]<filename>` will copy the file `lovelace/<path>/<filename>` to `www/lovelace/<filename>` and be replaced with `/local/lovelace/<filename>`. A timestamp will be added after the url to make sure any cache of the file is invalidated between runs.
- [jinja2 templates](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/2.10/templates/) allows for variables, loops, macros and flow controll.


## Example

`lovelace/main.yaml`:

```yaml
title: My Awesome Home

# Copy resources from anywhere to www/lovelace and include them
resources:
  - url: !resource monster-card/monster-card.js
    type: js
  - url: !resource /home/hass/tracker-card/tracker-card.js?v=0.1.4
    type: js

views:
  - title: Home
    id: home
    cards:
      - type: picture_entity
        image: http://placekitten.com/6/200/300
        entity: light.cat_light
      - !include presence_tracker.yaml
      - !include lights.yaml
  - !include family_view.yaml
```

---

`lovelace/family_view.yaml`:

```yaml
title: Family
id: family
cards:
  - !include presence_tracker.yaml
```

---

`lovelace/presence_tracker.yaml`:

```yaml
type: entity_filter
entities:
  - device_tracker.paulus
  - device_tracker.anne_there
state_filter:
  - 'home'
card:
  type: glance
  title: People that are home
```

---

`lovelace/lights.yaml`

```yaml
{% macro light_pe(switch, image) %}
{ type: picture-entity,
  entity: {{switch}},
  image: !resource {{image}}
  show_state: false,
  tap_action: toggle
}
{% endmacro %}
type: vertical-stack
cards:
  - {{ light_pe('light.kitchen_light', 'images/kitchen_light.png') }}
  - {{ light_pe('light.bedroom', 'images/bedroom_light.png') }}
```

### Experimental feature
If `lovelace-gen.py` is run with arguments `lovelace-gen.py http://ha-base-url
password` it will populate the jinja variable `states` with the current state.

Then you can do things like

```yaml
excluded_entities:
  {% for state in states.automation %}
  - {{ states.automation[state].entity_id }}
  {% endfor %}
```

It doesn't work exactly like in home-assistant templates... you'll have to experiment a bit.
